Firstly I would like to thank my supervisors: Dominique Fohr and Irina Illina for their amazing supports and knowledge while I was doing the internship. In addition, I highly appreciated the help of Multispeech team, especially Ismael Bada for helping me out tremendously in related to the script and Imran Sheikh for giving me overall knowledge of speech recognition. \\

I never forget to thank my family, my friends, and Feby Rara for giving me unlimited supports and love. Without them, this thesis will not be possible.
